> Prior to Boeing, Christophe worked just under 2 years at another defense contractor, General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton CT, on Nuclear Submarines used by the Navy.
>
> Christophe earned his Master of Engineering at Villanova University with a focus in electromechanical and controls, and earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering at Temple University, graduating Magna Cum Laude.  
>
> Christophe is from Northeast Philadelphia and enjoys playing hockey and learning to code in Python and MATLAB.  Christophe is currently interested in Python and MATLAB coding, Machine and Deep Learning, and Blockchain.
>
> Christophe would like to focus his career going forward on physical system  modeling and simulation, such as in Simscape (Simulink) and Easy5, to enhance capabilities of system design, and component design and integration.

*May 2012 - Present (~6 yrs)*
> *Recent work highlights 2017-2018*
> - Simulated a V-22 hydraulic subsystem in [MSC Easy5](http://www.mscsoftware.com/product/easy5) as part of a larger multi-domain aero modeling effort to simulate the V-22's response to different refueling scenarios for the [V-22 Aerial Refueling System (VARS)](https://breakingdefense.com/2016/05/v-22-refueling-contract-highlights-close-ties-to-f-35/).
>   - Leveraged [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) [programming and scripting](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/programming-and-data-types.html) to [handle big data analysis](), [dashboard visualization](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/graphics.html), [file and folder directory management](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/file-operations.html), and automatic [report generation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/rptgen/index.html?searchHighlight=report&s_tid=doc_srchtitle) of more than 30+ cases of large simulation results. [(Source code example here)](https://github.com/ccgarant/big-data-matlab-import-and-plot-workflow).
> - Performed research and early specification development as part of a 2017 R&D whitepaper effort to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating new electromechanical actuators for the V-22 platform. 
> - Released a 17 page modification drawing to upgrade the older aircraft’s cockpit mechanical flight controls configuration as part of the [Common Configuration – Readiness and Modernization (CC-RAM)](https://breakingdefense.com/2018/02/streamlined-mv-22-maintenance-from-70-osprey-types-down-to-5/) effort.
>   - Coded a Python script, due to the sheer multitude of parts, to count hardware stack-ups and generate an ordered and counted hardware Parts List. [(Source code example here)](https://github.com/ccgarant/Parts-List-Generator).
> - Lead grass roots effort to improve the V-22 flying (handling) qualities by redesigning a lowly, out-of-the-comfort zone, material cyclic stick protective boot cover assembly.
>   - Required humble, inglorious grunt work with material flat patterns.
>   - Culminated in a forced retrofit to the entire V-22 Fleet.  
>   - This simple, lowly change has big impacts by reducing the risk of bad landings in reduced visibility which may [ultimately save lives and loss of aircraft](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2015/11/23/pilot-missteps-brownout-led-to-hawaii-osprey-crash/).
> - Lead the design and safety-of-flight qualification effort for new tie rod (linkages) components for the VARS program.
