## Bio
> Christophe currently works at Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed Martin Company, supporting Blackhawk platform Flight Controls and Autonomous Systems testing support.  He supports autonomous programs lab integration testing, verification, and validation, as well as supporting legacy production obsolescence efforts.
>
> Christophe's prior bulk experience was working at Boeing Vertical Lift, Philadelphia, as a Mechanical System Design & Analysis Engineer on the V-22 Osprey, a unique fly-by-wire tiltrotor used by the Marines and Air Force.  Christophe was a cognizant engineer of the Mechanical Flight Controls, a mix of electromechanical actuators and sensors to the flight controls, as well as build-to-print machined parts. Christophe also supported the V-22 Hydraulics, namely teardown investigations and testing on the variable displacement pump, and a pressure reducing pallet design for refueling.
>
> Prior to Boeing, Christophe worked just under 2 years at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton CT, on Nuclear Submarines used by the Navy.  Christophe supported trade studies for the Ohio (Columbia) Replacement program of hydraulic versus electromechanical actuation.
>
> Christophe earned his Master of Engineering at Villanova University with a focus in electromechanical and controls in 2017, and earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering at Temple University, graduating Magna Cum Laude in 2010.  
>
> Christophe is originally from Philadelphia and enjoys playing hockey, learning to code in Python and Haskell, and sampling good beer.  Christophe is also passionate about learning hard money principles of Austrian Economics, Bitcoin, Cardano, and how it can change the world.
